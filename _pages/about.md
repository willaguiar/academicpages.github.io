I am a physical oceanographer and currently a Ph.D. candidate in oceanography in the Oceanographic Institute of the Federal University of the Rio Grande (FURG-Brazil), advised by Prof. [Mauricio M. Mata](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mauricio_Mata).

The focus of my research is the large-scale ocean circulation and its effect on climate, with particular focus on  the following topics: polar climate, past and future large-scale circulation, and interactions between sea ice, deep circulation, and atmosphere.
